<h1><b>Introduction</b></h1>
<p>The Heart disease prediction system consists of the application of four machine learning algorithms. This project uses 13 characteristics commonly found in heart disease patients such as blood pressure, type of chest pain, cholesterol, etc. In order to diagnose the patient. The algorithms show varying levels of success depending on the volume of the dataset with certain classifiers showing a significant fluctuation. The dataset has been split in three different ratios 80:20, 70:30 and 60:40 for training and testing data respectively. Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression are the algorithms implemented in this project. The results provided by each algorithm has been used to determine statistics such as accuracy (training and testing), precision, recall and f1- score in order to compare these four algorithms across the three different splits. Random Forest has shown the highest testing accuracy of 98.2%, 98.7% and 100% across the splits 60:40, 70:30 and 80:20 respectively. Similarly, KNN displays a testing accuracy 91.7%, 93.5% and 96.1% respectively, Decision Tree has a testing accuracy of 94.1%, 87.9%, 91.2% respectively. Logistic Regression shows the lowest testing accuracy in comparison of 83.6%, 83.1% and 83.4%. These algorithms show a high percentage of accuracy making them valuable tools in predicting heart diseases in the early stages without taking up large amounts of resources. This can prove to be an effective diagnosing tool used by doctors for quick assessments and increases the chances of potentially saving a patient’s life.</p>

<h2>Result</h2>
<p>Result says that among all the splits Random Forest gives the best testing accuracy with 98.6% and Lowest accuracy is obtained from Logistic regression with 84% 70:30 split. This helps to conclude that Random Forest is best suitable for prediction. Also, the overall performance of all the 4 machine learning algorithms used in this research, is observed to be efficient at 70% training set and 30% testing set.</p>
